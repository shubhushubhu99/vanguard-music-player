`apt` will automatically install all required dependencies (`mpv`, `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`) alongside the application.

Once installed, launch Vanguard Player from your application menu or run:

```bash
vanguard-player
```

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable toolchain)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) v2

On Linux, also install the system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install mpv yt-dlp ffmpeg libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

On Windows, the required binaries (`mpv`, `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`) must be placed in `src-tauri/binaries/` before building.

Download **`binaries.zip`** from the [Releases](../../releases) page, extract it, and copy the contents into `src-tauri/binaries/`. The folder should look like this:

```
src-tauri/binaries/
├── mpv-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
├── yt-dlp-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
├── ffmpeg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
└── ffprobe-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe
```

Then proceed with the build step below.

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishmweet/vanguard-music-player.git
cd vanguard-music-player
npm install
cargo tauri build
```

The output package will be at:

- **Linux:** `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/`
- **Windows:** `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`

For development with hot reload:

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```
